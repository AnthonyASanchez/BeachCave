            <p>The CSULB Department of Physical Therapy (PT) established multiple rehabilitation and training programs that serve the local community.
            These programs and available resources have lead to several collaborative projects using the CAVE involving the development of technologies to
            enhance motor skills and performance. There are three primary areas: <strong>Rehabilitation</strong>, <strong>Sport Training</strong>, and <strong>Musculoskeletal Modeling</strong>.</p>
