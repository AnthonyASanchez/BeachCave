            <p>The research in this area focuses on the use of the CAVE environment in studying the interaction between human and robot in a dynamic environment in order to develop effective
            control strategies for single and /or multiple user and robot collaboration. The applicants cover two primary areas:
              <strong>rehabilitation</strong> and
             <strong>advanced manufacturing</strong>.</p>
