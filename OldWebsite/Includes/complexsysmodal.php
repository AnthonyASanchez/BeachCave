            <p>The research proposed in this area focus on gaining basic understanding and develop metrics for
            evaluation of various aspects of human interactions in complex systems, which embody multiple sensory feedback,
            perturbations, advanced modes of display, and multiple users. The results of research activities in this area will enhance
            the development of human-machine technologies. There are two primary areas:
            <strong>Human Movement and Perception</strong> and <strong>Intelligent Cockpit</strong></p>
