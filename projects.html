				<p>
					<i><b>Description</b></i>
					<br>
					Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is an urban system for air passenger, cargo transportation, and other urban Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) services. This project incorporates UAM into a Virtual Reality (VR) system known as CAVE Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE). The system allows the projection of a simulation developed through the Unity game engine. With tools and Software Development Kits(SDK) such as Wrld 3D for Unity and Professional Drone Asset. The simulation puts the user in a drone and directs them to move from one location to another. User will control the movement of the drone and determined the pathway to arrive at the desired location

					<br>
				</p>
					<i><b>Hardware Setup</b></i>
					<br>
					Within CAVE, a simulation is projected onto the four walls surrounding the users like a cube. Around all eight corners of the cubes are eight cameras that track the positions of visible nodes up to 300 Hz and communicate it to the computer. The graphic projection of the simulation is all handled by a 12-core Intel Xeon E5-2650 v4 processor with Nvidia Quadro P5000 graphics card. Through the high computation power of the graphic card, it is possible to send graphical to four projectors at the same time to display the simulation.
					<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<i><b>Virtual Model</b></i>
					<br>
					The vehicle that the user will be in a modified version of a hexacopter 3D drone model available in the Professional Drone Pack. The interior of the hexacopter is a cockpit component available on aircraft models in the Silantro Flight Simulator Toolkit modified to have more open space. The models of the buildings and environment of the simulations are preset objects generated by Wrld 3D SDK.
					<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<i><b>Environment</b></i>
					<br>
					Around the users is a simulation of San Francisco (SF) from San Francisco Bay. The first objective of this simulation is for the user to fly the drone from the SF Bay to SF International Airport. While flying over the highway to get to SF International Airport, users will see landmarks such as the Golden Gate Bridge, Oracle Park, etc. The environment will have a low poly and colorful look to it to improve the frame rates of the simulation as much as possible.

				<a id = "VC"><h2><u>Virtual Clinic</u></h2></a>
				<p>
					<i><b>Description</b></i>
					<br>
					The primary goal of the study is to determine if the virtual environment can be reliably used instead of an actual clinical environment in the physical therapy (PT) lab. The setup in the CAVE environment includes simulation of a PT lab at CSULB, focusing on a balancing apparatus consisting of a pendulum that swings and slightly perturbs the subject’s upper torso at the shoulder level.  Consequently, the subject’s reaction time, ground forces, and muscular activation are measured. The balancing apparatus is recreated in the immersive CAVE VR environment. The contact force from the swinging pendulum will be created through a vest that provides tactile feedback at the approximate location the pendulum would hit in a real setup.<br>
				</p>
					<i><b>Hardware Setup</b></i>
					<br>
					The independently made haptic vest simulating the force feedback from a pendulum uses Engineering Acoustics, Inc. Tatcor Control unit. The biomechanical response of the virtual and real pendulum will be compared by ART motion trackers and Ground Reaction Forces. The motion tracking glasses were provided by ART, and the software plugin being MiddleVR.<br><br>

					The balancing pendulum was created by a senior project group and currently is being used for balancing test in CSULB.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<i><b>Virtual Model</b></i>
					<br>
					In order to have haptic feedback in the environment. The stimulus for starting the feedback was consistent with when the virtual pendulum would hit the markers at the clavicles, similar to real life. Interfacing scripts were provided by EAI.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<i><b>Environment</b></i>
					<br>
					The environments were modelled and scaled according to  a physical therapy lab at CSULB and provide a realistic feel of the environment.

		<!-- DRIVING SIMULATOR -->
		<div class = "continer-fluid">
			<div class = "infoCard">
				<a id = "DS"><h2><u>Driving Simulation</u></h2></a>
				<p>
					<i><b>Description</b></i>
					<br>
					Many of the accidents that happen in traffic are due to human failure. The application of virtual driving simulator abates the cost of test cars and it is unnecessary to go to the testing field conducting a variety of complex experiments. Building a Virtual Driving Simulator fulfils the purpose of training a driver to get accustomed and drive in environments that simulate situations to prepare the user for specific scenarios, improving driver reaction, and behavior in real world situations.<br>
				</p>
					<i><b>Hardware Setup</b></i>
					<br>
					The Logitech G29 was chosen as the controller, which contains a force feedback racingwheel, a shifter module; gas, brake and clutch pedals for maneuvering the vehicle in the Virtual Environment. Logitech has Provided SDK’s and documentation on their libraries. The motion tracking glasses were provided by ART, and the software plugin being MiddleVR. The center nodes of the glasses in the CAVE environment had to be configured using the MiddleVR software.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<i><b>Vehicle Model</b></i>
					<br>
					In order to have a controllable vehicle in the environment. A vehicle model comprising of physical parameters was scripted and attached to the graphical model of the vehicle. A script called carcontroller.cs was scripted which defined the physical parameters, which could be altered in the inspector window of Unity 3D.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<i><b>Environment</b></i>
					<br>
					The environments were modelled and scaled according the display dimensions and provide a realistic feel of the environment. The environments were made based on our testing requirements for the project. <br>
