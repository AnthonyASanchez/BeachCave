				<h1><u>Virtual Clinic</u></h1>
				<p>
					<i><b>Description</b></i>
					<br>
					The primary goal of the study is to determine if the virtual environment can be reliably used instead of an actual clinical environment in the physical therapy (PT) lab. The setup in the CAVE environment includes simulation of a PT lab at CSULB, focusing on a balancing apparatus consisting of a pendulum that swings and slightly perturbs the subject’s upper torso at the shoulder level.  Consequently, the subject’s reaction time, ground forces, and muscular activation are measured. The balancing apparatus is recreated in the immersive CAVE VR environment. The contact force from the swinging pendulum will be created through a vest that provides tactile feedback at the approximate location the pendulum would hit in a real setup.<br>
				</p>
					<i><b>Hardware Setup</b></i>
					<br>
					The independently made haptic vest simulating the force feedback from a pendulum uses Engineering Acoustics, Inc. Tatcor Control unit. The biomechanical response of the virtual and real pendulum will be compared by ART motion trackers and Ground Reaction Forces. The motion tracking glasses were provided by ART, and the software plugin being MiddleVR.<br><br>

					The balancing pendulum was created by a senior project group and currently is being used for balancing test in CSULB.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<i><b>Virtual Model</b></i>
					<br>
					In order to have haptic feedback in the environment. The stimulus for starting the feedback was consistent with when the virtual pendulum would hit the markers at the clavicles, similar to real life. Interfacing scripts were provided by EAI.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<i><b>Environment</b></i>
					<br>
					The environments were modelled and scaled according to  a physical therapy lab at CSULB and provide a realistic feel of the environment.

		<!-- DRIVING SIMULATOR -->

				<h1><u>Driving Simulation</u></h1>
				<p>
					<i><b>Description</b></i>
					<br>
					Many of the accidents that happen in traffic are due to human failure. The application of virtual driving simulator abates the cost of test cars and it is unnecessary to go to the testing field conducting a variety of complex experiments. Building a Virtual Driving Simulator fulfils the purpose of training a driver to get accustomed and drive in environments that simulate situations to prepare the user for specific scenarios, improving driver reaction, and behavior in real world situations.<br>
				</p>
					<i><b>Hardware Setup</b></i>
					<br>
					The Logitech G29 was chosen as the controller, which contains a force feedback racingwheel, a shifter module; gas, brake and clutch pedals for maneuvering the vehicle in the Virtual Environment. Logitech has Provided SDK’s and documentation on their libraries. The motion tracking glasses were provided by ART, and the software plugin being MiddleVR. The center nodes of the glasses in the CAVE environment had to be configured using the MiddleVR software.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<i><b>Vehicle Model</b></i>
					<br>
					In order to have a controllable vehicle in the environment. A vehicle model comprising of physical parameters was scripted and attached to the graphical model of the vehicle. A script called carcontroller.cs was scripted which defined the physical parameters, which could be altered in the inspector window of Unity 3D.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<i><b>Environment</b></i>
					<br>
					The environments were modelled and scaled according the display dimensions and provide a realistic feel of the environment. The environments were made based on our testing requirements for the project.
